## GutenBard

GutenBard will be a tool for improvisational writing, assisted by CharCNN (via ML5). For the time being, GutenBard is a work in progress. Following is an incomplete list of work that needs doing.

### General to-do
* Publish static site to GitHub pages
* Mobile optimization

### Editor improvements
* Don't update when selecting a range of text
* Clear secondary text immedately when inserting other text (instead of moving it briefly)
* Disambiguate different styles/types of quotation marks
