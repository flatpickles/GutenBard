## GutenBard

GutenBard is a tool for improvisational writing, built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs), assisted by CharCNN (via [ML5](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/charrnn)) with a [pre-trained model](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models/tree/main/models/charRNN) of Hemingway's written works. It is far from perfect, but is hopefully sufficiently polished to be an appealing tool for surrealistic noodling.
